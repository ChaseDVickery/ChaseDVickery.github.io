### Description
I am developing a game and level maker using Unity's Data Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS), which has turned out to be much more involved than I initially thought it would be. Switching from an object-oriented way of thinking to a data-oriented one has not been easy, but in return I have learned so much about the job system (multithreading), Entity Component System (ECS), sprite rendering, project organization, source generation, and handling user-generated content.
