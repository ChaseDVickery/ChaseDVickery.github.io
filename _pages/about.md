Hello, there! I'm Chase Vickery, a first year PhD student at Virginia Tech. I was born and raised in Lexington, KY and completed my undergraduate education in 2021 from the [University of Kentucky](https://www.uky.edu/) with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. In my free time, I like [fooling around with machine learning models](https://github.com/ChaseDVickery/UFO-Report-Generator) and working on digital art.

My current interests are in deep reinforcement learning and communication in multi-agent systems where I am investigating using more 2D spatial information to encode agent beliefs in the [CoMON environment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05769.pdf).
