Hello, there! I'm Chase Vickery, a Virginia Tech alumnus. I was born and raised in Lexington, KY and completed my undergraduate education in 2021 from the [University of Kentucky](https://www.uky.edu/) with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. In 2024 I completed my Masters at Virginia Tech. In my free time, I like [fooling around with machine learning models](https://github.com/ChaseDVickery/UFO-Report-Generator) and working on digital art.

My current interests are in inverse reinforcement learning and emergent communication pretraining.
