### Description
Investigations entailed using existing methods to develop emergent languages to be utilized as a pretraining dataset for multimodal-LLMs. Tests included downstream tasks such as Visual Grounding and VQA.

By training a Speaker agent that outputs an emergent language describing images, we used the resulting language to pretrain a multimodal LLM ,<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03052">OFA</a>, with corresponding images for various multimodal learning tasks.
