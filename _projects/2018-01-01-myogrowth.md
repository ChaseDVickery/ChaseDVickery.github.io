### Description
MyoGrowth is a simulation designed to model interactions between myoblasts, muscle fibers, myofibrils, and muscle fiber nuclei in the genesis and growth of muscle tissue. Work was done with Dr. Kenneth Campbell and Dr. John McCarthy of the University of Kentucky Physiology Department. Disclosed to the UKY Office of Technology Commercialization in 2018.

### Video Example
This video shows an example of the modeling done with MyoGrowth in which multiple myoblasts fuse to form myofibrils and muslcle fibers. Subsequent myoblasts that make contact with a muscle fiber are assimilated into it as a nucleus.
