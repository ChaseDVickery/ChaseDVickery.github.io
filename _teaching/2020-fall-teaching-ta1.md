I worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant for a Computer Organization class during the fall of 2020. This involved modifying prior assignments and answering student questions about concepts, projects, and homework during office hours. The class material dealt with the MIPS assembly language and datapath as well as concepts related to memory and caching.
