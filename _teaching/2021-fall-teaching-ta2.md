I worked as an graduate teaching assistant for an Intro to Computer Organization class during the fall of 2021. This involved grading student assignments and exams and answering student questions about concepts, projects, and homework during office hours (10 hr./week). The class material dealt with the MIPS assembly language and datapath as well as concepts related to memory and caching.
