This talk was given for the Muscle Forum at the University of Kentucky in September of 2018. I spoke about work that I did over the summer of 2018 concerning modeling skeletal muscle genesis and growth using agent-based modeling. The aim was to create a simulation that could model the relationship between myoblasts, muscle fibers, myofibrils, and nuclei in order to gain more insight about the growth of muscle fibers from the time of their generation due to the fusion of myoblasts.

### Video Example
This video shows an example of the modeling done with MyoGrowth in which multiple myoblasts fuse to form myofibrils and muslcle fibers. Subsequent myoblasts that make contact with a muscle fiber are assimilated into it as a nucleus.
